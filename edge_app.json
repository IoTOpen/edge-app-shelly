These devices need to connect to the Edge Client MQTT broker on\nport 1883 (unsecured). The MQTT settings need to be done in the Web interface\nfor the device by adding the IP or hostname of the broker. Make sure that the\nbroker is running and listening on the same network range as the edge client.\n\nWhen Shelly devices connect to the broker they \"announce\" their presence. This\nmessage is used to add the device and functions as needed. If the Shelly device\nis restarted the app will once again check that all functions are created\ncorrectly.",
